Ramadan 2026 Calendar

This small Obsidian plugin shows a simple 30-day Ramadan calendar (Ramadan 2026). Click any day to toggle it green and add a checkmark; the plugin saves your progress.

Installation (local, manual):

1. In your Obsidian vault, open the folder `.obsidian/plugins/`.
2. Copy the folder `obsidian-ramadan-2026` from this workspace into `.obsidian/plugins/` so the path looks like `.obsidian/plugins/ramadan-2026/`.
3. Restart Obsidian (or click "Reload plugins") and enable "Ramadan 2026 Calendar" in Settings → Community plugins (or Core plugins if using local plugins).

Usage:

- Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P) and run "Open Ramadan 2026 Calendar", or click the ribbon icon (calendar) to open the modal.
- Click any day to mark/unmark it. State is automatically saved.
